**wind dir shaft length calculation:
(boss length)+(bearing length)+(0.050 clearance)+(nub into indicator shaft)-(magnet length)-(0.050 clearance above chip)-(3.5mm thickness of PCB+chip package)
=
0.250 + 9/32 + 0.050 + 0.125 - 0.125 - 0.050 - 0.134 = 0.3972 inches

**Wind dir indicator shaft still needs flag balanced + attachments figured out
**Wind dir assembly needs 4-40 assembly screw + pocket in shaft is too deep (supporting shaft is actualy too short - above formula must be wrong.)

**main body probbaly needs diameter increased, to accomadate 4-40 standoffs between PCBs and o-ring groove by wind indicator
**main body probably needs length increased, to accomade larger hollow shaft for exiting wires
